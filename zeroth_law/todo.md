# Zeroth_Law_Template Project Tasks and Notes

## Repeating Tasks
- [∞] [Critical] Adhere to the principles as laid out in Zeroth Law in [text](docs/ZerothLawAIFramework.py.md)
- [∞] [High] Update [text](todo.md) every iteration
- [∞] [Medium] Verify pytest tests for all files and features exist
- [∞] [Low] Update Header and Footer of all modified files

## Pending Features
- [x] Ensure all public functions and classes have comprehensive docstrings.
- [ ] Add usage examples in docstrings for complex functions.
- [ ] Review and update README files to reflect the latest project status.
- [ ] Add usage examples in docstrings for complex functions.
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality checks.
- [ ] Set up CI to run tests and checks automatically.
- [ ] Identify and refactor functions/classes that exceed recommended line count or complexity.
- [ ] Review all functions for explicit error handling and logging.
- [ ] Optimize compliance evaluation logic in `evaluate_compliance` function.
- [ ] Review third-party dependencies for relevance and document rationale.

### High Priority
- [x] Write unit tests for all new features and enhance existing test coverage.

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Identify and refactor functions/classes that exceed recommended line count or complexity.
- [ ] Review all functions for explicit error handling and logging.
- [ ] Optimize compliance evaluation logic in `evaluate_compliance` function.

### Low Priority
- [ ] Review third-party dependencies for relevance and document rationale.
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of excluded files in `analyze_file` logic.
- [x] Address unused imports in `analyzer.py` (`generate_report`, `template_converter.py`, `generate_summary_report`, `ConfigError`).

## Features to Revisit

- [x] Address unused imports in `analyzer.py` (`generate_report`, `generate_summary_report`, `ConfigError`).
- [ ] Review and optimize compliance evaluation logic in `evaluate_compliance` function.

## Key Implementation Notes

## Completed Implemented Features
- [x] Created missing unit tests for utils.py and reporting.py
- [x] Fixed unused imports in analyzer.py (removed generate_report, generate_summary_report, and ConfigError)
- [x] Added comprehensive docstrings to core files:
  - analyzer.py: All functions documented with Args, Returns, Examples
  - metrics/cyclomatic_complexity.py: Full class and method documentation
  - metrics/docstring_coverage.py: Added detailed examples and return info
  - metrics/naming.py: Added scoring explanation and examples
