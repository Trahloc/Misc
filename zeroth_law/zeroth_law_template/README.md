## Zeroth Law Template

## Configuration

### Configuration File

The project uses a configuration file to manage settings. The following formats are supported:

- **TOML**: Recommended for its simplicity and readability.
- **YAML**: Useful for complex configurations.
- **JSON**: Commonly used but less human-readable.

### Example Configuration (zeroth_law_template.toml)

```toml
[app]
name = "zeroth_law_template"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A project created with the Zeroth Law AI Framework"
debug = false

[logging]
level = "INFO"
format = "%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s"
date_format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
log_file = null

[paths]
data_dir = "data"
output_dir = "output"
cache_dir = ".cache"
```

### Configuration Precedence

The configuration is loaded in the following order:

1. **Default Values**: Defined in the code.
2. **Configuration File**: Loaded from the specified path or common locations.
3. **Environment Variables**: Prefixed with `APP_` (e.g., `APP_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG`).

### Environment Variable Configuration

You can configure the application using environment variables. The naming convention is as follows:

- `APP_<SECTION>_<KEY>` (e.g., `APP_LOGGING_LEVEL`)
