## 1. INTRODUCTION
This document provides an overview of the configuration options available for the Zeroth Law Template, including supported file formats and environment variable settings.

## 2. CONFIGURATION FILE FORMATS

### 2.1 Supported Formats
The Zeroth Law Template supports the following configuration file formats:
- **JSON**: A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- **YAML**: A human-readable data serialization standard that is often used for configuration files.
- **TOML**: A minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to its clear semantics.

### 2.2 Precedence of Configuration Sources
When loading configuration settings, the following precedence is applied:
1. **Default Values**: Hardcoded defaults defined in the code.
2. **Configuration Files**: Values specified in configuration files (JSON, YAML, TOML).
3. **Environment Variables**: Values set in the environment, which can override both defaults and file settings.

## 3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

### 3.1 Naming Conventions
Environment variables should follow the naming convention of `PROJECT_NAME_SETTING`, where `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of your project in uppercase, and `SETTING` is the specific configuration option.

### 3.2 Available Options
- **DATABASE_URL**: The URL for the database connection.
- **API_KEY**: The key used for authenticating API requests.
- **DEBUG_MODE**: A boolean flag to enable or disable debug mode.

### 3.3 Example
