# Tmux Service Manager Project Structure

Following the Zeroth Law principles, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle, here's the proposed project structure:

```
tmux_manager/
├── __init__.py                # Public API exports
├── server_management.py       # Tmux server lifecycle functions
├── session_management.py      # Tmux session creation/restoration
├── systemd_integration.py     # Systemd service interactions
├── status_reporting.py        # Status and diagnostic reporting
├── config_management.py       # Configuration handling
└── cli.py                     # Command-line interface
```

Each file will focus on a single responsibility, and `__init__.py` will orchestrate functionality and define the public API.

## Implementation Plan

1. First create the core functions in each module
2. Implement the CLI interface 
3. Define the public API in `__init__.py`
4. Add error handling and logging
5. Implement configuration management

This structure will make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand for both humans and AI.
