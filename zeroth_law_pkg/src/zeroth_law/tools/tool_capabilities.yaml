# src/zeroth_law/tools/tool_capabilities.yaml
# Defines the functional roles (capabilities) of known tools for ZLT orchestration.
# This file is used by ZLT to determine which tools can perform a specific action
# (e.g., finding all tools with the 'Formatter' capability for the 'zlt format' action).
#
# Tool ID (matches directory name and tool_index.json key)
# Capabilities are based on the matrix provided on YYYY-MM-DD.
# Potential capability values include:
#   Formatter, Linter, Complexity Analyzer, Fuzzer, Security Analyzer,
#   Type Checker, Test Runner, Code Coverage, Static Analyzer, Dead Code Finder,
#   CI Integration, Exit Code Support, JSON/XML Output
