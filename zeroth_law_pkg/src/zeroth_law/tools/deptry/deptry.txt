Usage: deptry [OPTIONS] ROOT...

  Find dependency issues in your Python project.

  ROOT is the path to the root directory of the project to be scanned. For
  instance, to invoke deptry in the current directory:

      deptry .

  If your project has multiple source directories, multiple ROOT can be
  specified.  For instance, to invoke deptry in both 'src' and 'worker'
  directories:

      deptry src worker

Options:
  -v, --verbose                   Boolean flag for verbosity. Using this flag
                                  will display more information about files,
                                  imports and dependencies while running.
  --config PATH                   Path to the pyproject.toml file to read
                                  configuration from.
  --no-ansi                       Disable ANSI characters in terminal output.
  -i, --ignore TUPLE              A comma-separated list of error codes to
                                  ignore. e.g. `deptry --ignore DEP001,DEP002`
                                  For more information regarding the error
                                  codes, see https://deptry.com/issue-codes/
  -pri, --per-rule-ignores MAPPING
                                  A comma-separated mapping of packages or
                                  modules to be ignored per error code. . e.g.
                                  ``deptry . --per-rule-ignores
                                  DEP001=matplotlib,DEP002=pandas|numpy`` For
                                  more information regarding the error codes,
                                  see https://deptry.com/issue-codes/
  -e, --exclude TEXT              A regular expression for directories or
                                  files in which .py files should not be
                                  scanned for imports to determine if there
                                  are dependency issues. Can be used multiple
                                  times by specifying the argument multiple
                                  times. re.match() is used to match the
                                  expressions, which by default checks for a
                                  match only at the beginning of a string. For
                                  example: `deptry . -e ".*/foo/" -e bar"`
                                  Note that this overwrites the defaults.
                                  [default: venv, \.venv, \.direnv, tests,
                                  \.git, setup\.py]
  -ee, --extend-exclude TEXT      Like --exclude, but adds additional files
                                  and directories on top of the excluded ones
                                  instead of overwriting the defaults. (Useful
                                  if you simply want to add to the default)
                                  `deptry . -ee ".*/foo/" -ee bar"`
  -nb, --ignore-notebooks         Boolean flag to specify if notebooks should
                                  be ignored while scanning for imports.
  --version                       Display the current version and exit.
  -rf, --requirements-files TUPLE
                                  .txt files to scan for dependencies. If a
                                  file called pyproject.toml with a
                                  [tool.poetry.dependencies] or [project]
                                  section is found, this argument is ignored
                                  and the dependencies are extracted from the
                                  pyproject.toml file instead. Can be multiple
                                  e.g. `deptry . --requirements-files
                                  req/prod.txt,req/extra.txt` [default:
                                  requirements.txt]
  -rfd, --requirements-files-dev TUPLE
                                  .txt files to scan for additional
                                  development dependencies. If a file called
                                  pyproject.toml with a
                                  [tool.poetry.dependencies] or [project]
                                  section is found, this argument is ignored
                                  and the dependencies are extracted from the
                                  pyproject.toml file instead. Can be multiple
                                  e.g. `deptry . --requirements-files-dev
                                  req/dev.txt,req/test.txt`  [default: dev-
                                  requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt]
  -kf, --known-first-party TEXT   Modules to consider as first party ones.
  -o, --json-output TEXT          If specified, a summary of the dependency
                                  issues found will be written to the output
                                  location specified. e.g. `deptry . -o
                                  deptry.json`
  -pmnm, --package-module-name-map MAPPING
                                  Manually defined module names belonging to
                                  packages. For example; `deptry . --package-
                                  module-name-map package_1=module_a,package_2
                                  =module_b|module_c`.
  -ddg, --pep621-dev-dependency-groups TUPLE
                                  For projects that use PEP621 and that do not
                                  use a build tool that has its own method of
                                  declaring development dependencies, this
                                  argument provides the option to specify
                                  which groups under [project.optional-
                                  dependencies] in pyproject.toml should be
                                  considered development dependencies. For
                                  example, use `--pep621-dev-dependency-groups
                                  tests,docs` to mark the dependencies in the
                                  groups 'tests' and 'docs' as development
                                  dependencies.
  --experimental-namespace-package
                                  Enable experimental support for namespace
                                  package (PEP 420) when detecting local
                                  modules (https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/).
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
