                paths [paths ...]

The output can be filtered using the *min* and *max* flags. In addition to
that, by default complexity score is not displayed.

positional arguments:
  paths                 The paths where to find modules or packages to
                        analyze. More than one path is allowed.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --min <str>       The minimum complexity to display (default to A).
  -x, --max <str>       The maximum complexity to display (default to F).
  -s, --show-complexity
                        Whether or not to show the actual complexity score
                        together with the A-F rank. Default to False.
  -a, --average         If True, at the end of the analysis display the
                        average complexity. Default to False.
  -e, --exclude <str>   Exclude files only when their path matches one of
                        these glob patterns. Usually needs quoting at the
                        command line.
  -i, --ignore <str>    Ignore directories when their name matches one of
                        these glob patterns: radon won't even descend into
                        them. By default, hidden directories (starting with
                        '.') are ignored.
  -o, --order <str>     The ordering function. Can be SCORE, LINES or ALPHA.
  -j, --json            Format results in JSON.
  --no-assert           Do not count `assert` statements when computing
                        complexity.
  --show-closures       Add closures/inner classes to the output.
  --total-average       Like `-a, --average`, but it is not influenced by
                        `min` and `max`. Every analyzed block is counted, no
                        matter whether it is displayed or not.
  --xml                 Format results in XML (compatible with CCM).
  --md                  Format results in Markdown.
  --codeclimate         Format results for Code Climate.
  -O, --output-file <str>
                        The output file (default to stdout).
  --include-ipynb       Include IPython Notebook files
  --ipynb-cells         Include reports for individual IPYNB cells
