The Halstead metrics are a series of measurements meant to quantitatively
measure the complexity of code, including the difficulty a programmer would
have in writing it.

positional arguments:
  paths                 The paths where to find modules or packages to
                        analyze. More than one path is allowed.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e, --exclude <str>   Exclude files only when their path matches one of
                        these glob patterns. Usually needs quoting at the
                        command line.
  -i, --ignore <str>    Ignore directories when their name matches one of
                        these glob patterns: radon won't even descend into
                        them. By default, hidden directories (starting with
                        '.') are ignored.
  -j, --json            Format results in JSON.
  -f, --functions       Analyze files by top-level functions instead of as a
                        whole.
  -O, --output-file <str>
                        The output file (default to stdout).
  --include-ipynb       Include IPython Notebook files
  --ipynb-cells         Include reports for individual IPYNB cells
