usage: radon mi [-h] [-n <str>] [-x <str>] [-m] [-e <str>] [-i <str>] [-s]

                paths [paths ...]

The maintainability index (MI) is a compound metric, with the primary aim
being to determine how easy it will be to maintain a particular body of code.

positional arguments:
  paths                 The paths where to find modules or packages to
                        analyze. More than one path is allowed.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --min <str>       The minimum MI to display (default to A).
  -x, --max <str>       The maximum MI to display (default to C).
  -m, --multi           If given, multiline strings are not counted as
                        comments.
  -e, --exclude <str>   Exclude files only when their path matches one of
                        these glob patterns. Usually needs quoting at the
                        command line.
  -i, --ignore <str>    Ignore directories when their name matches one of
                        these glob patterns: radon won't even descend into
                        them. By default, hidden directories (starting with
                        '.') are ignored.
  -s, --show            If given, the actual MI value is shown in results.
  -j, --json            Format results in JSON.
  --sort                If given, results are sorted in ascending order.
  -O, --output-file <str>
                        The output file (default to stdout).
  --include-ipynb       Include IPython Notebook files
  --ipynb-cells         Include reports for individual IPYNB cells
