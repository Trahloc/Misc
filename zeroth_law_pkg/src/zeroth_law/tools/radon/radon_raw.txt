                 paths [paths ...]

Analyze the given Python modules and compute raw metrics.

positional arguments:
  paths                 The paths where to find modules or packages to
                        analyze. More than one path is allowed.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e, --exclude <str>   Exclude files only when their path matches one of
                        these glob patterns. Usually needs quoting at the
                        command line.
  -i, --ignore <str>    Ignore directories when their name matches one of
                        these glob patterns: radon won't even descend into
                        them. By default, hidden directories (starting with
                        '.') are ignored.
  -s, --summary         If given, at the end of the analysis display the
                        summary of the gathered metrics. Default to False.
  -j, --json            Format results in JSON. Note that the JSON export does
                        not include the summary (enabled with `-s,
                        --summary`).
  -O, --output-file <str>
                        The output file (default to stdout).
  --include-ipynb       Include IPython Notebook files
  --ipynb-cells         Include reports for individual IPYNB cells
