                           repo [hook]

positional arguments:
  repo                  Repository to source hooks from.
  hook                  A single hook-id to run

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --color {auto,always,never}
                        Whether to use color in output. Defaults to `auto`.
  -c, --config CONFIG   Path to alternate config file
  --ref, --rev REF      Manually select a rev to run against, otherwise the
                        `HEAD` revision will be used.
  --verbose, -v
  --all-files, -a       Run on all the files in the repo.
  --files [FILES ...]   Specific filenames to run hooks on.
  --show-diff-on-failure
                        When hooks fail, run `git diff` directly afterward.
  --hook-stage {commit-msg,post-checkout,post-commit,post-merge,post-rewrite,pre-commit,pre-merge-commit,pre-push,pre-rebase,prepare-commit-msg,manual}
                        The stage during which the hook is fired. One of
                        commit-msg, post-checkout, post-commit, post-merge,
                        post-rewrite, pre-commit, pre-merge-commit, pre-push,
                        pre-rebase, prepare-commit-msg, manual
  --remote-branch REMOTE_BRANCH
                        Remote branch ref used by `git push`.
  --local-branch LOCAL_BRANCH
                        Local branch ref used by `git push`.
  --from-ref, --source, -s FROM_REF
                        (for usage with `--to-ref`) -- this option represents
                        the original ref in a `from_ref...to_ref` diff
                        expression. For `pre-push` hooks, this represents the
                        branch you are pushing to. For `post-checkout` hooks,
                        this represents the branch that was previously checked
                        out.
  --to-ref, --origin, -o TO_REF
                        (for usage with `--from-ref`) -- this option
                        represents the destination ref in a
                        `from_ref...to_ref` diff expression. For `pre-push`
                        hooks, this represents the branch being pushed. For
                        `post-checkout` hooks, this represents the branch that
                        is now checked out.
  --pre-rebase-upstream PRE_REBASE_UPSTREAM
                        The upstream from which the series was forked.
  --pre-rebase-branch PRE_REBASE_BRANCH
                        The branch being rebased, and is not set when rebasing
                        the current branch.
  --commit-msg-filename COMMIT_MSG_FILENAME
                        Filename to check when running during `commit-msg`
  --prepare-commit-message-source PREPARE_COMMIT_MESSAGE_SOURCE
                        Source of the commit message (typically the second
                        argument to .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg)
  --commit-object-name COMMIT_OBJECT_NAME
                        Commit object name (typically the third argument to
                        .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg)
  --remote-name REMOTE_NAME
                        Remote name used by `git push`.
  --remote-url REMOTE_URL
                        Remote url used by `git push`.
  --checkout-type CHECKOUT_TYPE
                        Indicates whether the checkout was a branch checkout
                        (changing branches, flag=1) or a file checkout
                        (retrieving a file from the index, flag=0).
  --is-squash-merge IS_SQUASH_MERGE
                        During a post-merge hook, indicates whether the merge
                        was a squash merge
  --rewrite-command REWRITE_COMMAND
                        During a post-rewrite hook, specifies the command that
                        invoked the rewrite
