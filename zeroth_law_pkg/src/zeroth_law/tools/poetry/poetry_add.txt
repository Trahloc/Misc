Help:
  The add command adds required packages to your pyproject.toml and installs them.
  
  If you do not specify a version constraint, poetry will choose a suitable one based on the available package versions.
  
  You can specify a package in the following forms:
    - A single name (requests)
    - A name and a constraint (requests@^2.23.0)
    - A git url (git+https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git)
    - A git url with a revision (git+https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git#develop)
    - A subdirectory of a git repository (git+https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git#subdirectory=tests/fixtures/sample_project)
    - A git SSH url (git+ssh://git@github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git)
    - A git SSH url with a revision (git+ssh://git@github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git#develop)
    - A file path (../my-package/my-package.whl)
    - A directory (../my-package/)
    - A url (https://example.com/packages/my-package-0.1.0.tar.gz)
