usage: vulture [options] [PATH ...]

positional arguments:
  PATH                  Paths may be Python files or directories. For each
                        directory Vulture analyzes all contained *.py files.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --exclude PATTERNS    Comma-separated list of path patterns to ignore (e.g.,
                        "*settings.py,docs,*/test_*.py,venv"). Patterns may
                        contain glob wildcards (*, ?, [abc], [!abc]). A
                        PATTERN without glob wildcards is treated as
                        *PATTERN*. Patterns are matched against absolute
                        paths.
  --ignore-decorators PATTERNS
                        Comma-separated list of decorators. Functions and
                        classes using these decorators are ignored (e.g.,
                        "@app.route,@require_*"). Patterns may contain glob
                        wildcards (*, ?, [abc], [!abc]).
  --ignore-names PATTERNS
                        Comma-separated list of names to ignore (e.g.,
                        "visit_*,do_*"). Patterns may contain glob wildcards
                        (*, ?, [abc], [!abc]).
  --make-whitelist      Report unused code in a format that can be added to a
                        whitelist module.
  --min-confidence MIN_CONFIDENCE
                        Minimum confidence (between 0 and 100) for code to be
                        reported as unused.
  --sort-by-size        Sort unused functions and classes by their lines of
                        code.
  --config CONFIG       Path to pyproject.toml config file.
  -v, --verbose
  --version             show program's version number and exit
