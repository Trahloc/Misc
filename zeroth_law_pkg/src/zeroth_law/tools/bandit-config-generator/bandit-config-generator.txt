Bandit Config Generator

    This tool is used to generate an optional profile.  The profile may be used
    to include or skip tests and override values for plugins.

    When used to store an output profile, this tool will output a template that
    includes all plugins and their default settings.  Any settings which aren't
    being overridden can be safely removed from the profile and default values
    will be used.  Bandit will prefer settings from the profile over the built
    in values.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --show-defaults       show the default settings values for each plugin but do not output a profile
  -o, --out OUTPUT_FILE
                        output file to save profile
  -t, --tests TESTS     list of test names to run
  -s, --skip SKIPS      list of test names to skip
