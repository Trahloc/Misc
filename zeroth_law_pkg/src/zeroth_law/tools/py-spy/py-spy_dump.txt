py-spy-dump 
Dumps stack traces for a target program to stdout

USAGE:
    py-spy dump [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -p, --pid <pid>         PID of a running python program to spy on
    -c, --core <core>       Filename of coredump to display python stack traces from
        --full-filenames    Show full Python filenames, instead of shortening to show only the
                            package part
    -l, --locals            Show local variables for each frame. Passing multiple times (-ll)
                            increases verbosity

    -s, --subprocesses      Profile subprocesses of the original process
    -n, --native            Collect stack traces from native extensions written in Cython, C or C++
        --nonblocking       Don't pause the python process when collecting samples. Setting this
                            option will reduce the performance impact of sampling, but may lead to
                            inaccurate results
    -h, --help              Print help information
