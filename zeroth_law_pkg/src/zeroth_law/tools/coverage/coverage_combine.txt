Usage: coverage combine [options] <path1> <path2> ... <pathN>

Combine data from multiple coverage files. The combined results are written to
a single file representing the union of the data. The positional arguments are
data files or directories containing data files. If no paths are provided,
data files in the default data file's directory are combined.

Options:
  -a, --append          Append coverage data to .coverage, otherwise it starts
                        clean each time.
  --data-file=DATAFILE  Base name of the data files to operate on. Defaults to
                        '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
  --keep                Keep original coverage files, otherwise they are
                        deleted.
  -q, --quiet           Don't print messages about what is happening.
  --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                        COVERAGE_DEBUG]
  -h, --help            Get help on this command.
  --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                        'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                        tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]
