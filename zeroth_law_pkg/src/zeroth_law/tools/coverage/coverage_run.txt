Usage: coverage run [options] <pyfile> [program options]

Run a Python program, measuring code execution.

Options:
  -a, --append          Append coverage data to .coverage, otherwise it starts
                        clean each time.
  --branch              Measure branch coverage in addition to statement
                        coverage.
  --concurrency=LIBS    Properly measure code using a concurrency library.
                        Valid values are: eventlet, gevent, greenlet,
                        multiprocessing, thread, or a comma-list of them.
  --context=LABEL       The context label to record for this coverage run.
  --data-file=OUTFILE   Write the recorded coverage data to this file.
                        Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
  --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                        Include only files whose paths match one of these
                        patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                        quoted.
  -m, --module          <pyfile> is an importable Python module, not a script
                        path, to be run as 'python -m' would run it.
  --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                        Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
  -L, --pylib           Measure coverage even inside the Python installed
                        library, which isn't done by default.
  -p, --parallel-mode   Append the machine name, process id and random number
                        to the data file name to simplify collecting data from
                        many processes.
  --source=SRC1,SRC2,...
                        A list of directories or importable names of code to
                        measure.
  --timid               Use the slower Python trace function core.
  --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                        COVERAGE_DEBUG]
  -h, --help            Get help on this command.
  --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                        'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                        tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]
