Help:
  The version command shows the current version of the project or bumps the version of
  the project and writes the new version back to pyproject.toml if a valid
  bump rule is provided.
  
  The new version should ideally be a valid semver string or a valid bump rule:
  patch, minor, major, prepatch, preminor, premajor, prerelease.
